## Project Configuration Completion (Inifity)

- Completed session bootstrap reads per workspace policy: `SOUL.md`, `USER.md`, `MEMORY.md`, `memory/2026-02-19.md`.
- Fixed hardcoded project root references from `/Users/Code/workflow/translation` to dynamic repo-root detection in setup/start/run scripts.
- Updated cron timezone default in `scripts/setup_openclaw_v4.sh` to `America/New_York`.
- Added lock-skill installer resilience: skip skill install when destination skill folder already exists to reduce setup failures under rate limits.
- Updated env examples to repo-agnostic defaults and placeholders:
  - `V4_WORK_ROOT=$HOME/Translation Task`
  - `V4_KB_ROOT=$HOME/Knowledge Repository`
  - `V4_PYTHON_BIN=<project_root>/.venv/bin/python`
  - `OPENCLAW_NOTIFY_TARGET=""`
- Created local runtime config: `.env.v4.local` from example and bound `V4_PYTHON_BIN` to this repo.
- Created Python virtualenv `.venv` and installed `requirements.txt`.
- Ran `scripts/install_openclaw_translation_skill.sh` successfully.
- Ran `scripts/setup_openclaw_v4.sh` successfully (after handling temporary clawhub rate limits).
- Verified OpenClaw health OK and cron jobs active with payload paths pointing to `/Users/Code/workflow/Inifity`.

## Remaining User Inputs Needed

- Fill real IMAP credentials in `.env.v4.local`:
  - `V4_IMAP_HOST`, `V4_IMAP_USER`, `V4_IMAP_PASSWORD`
- Fill channel credentials if needed:
  - `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` (if Telegram channel is required)
  - `OPENCLAW_NOTIFY_TARGET` (notification recipient)
