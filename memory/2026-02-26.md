## Parents Survey (AR → EN) DOCX polish

- Worked on `_VERIFY/job_telegram_20260225_175522_c882923f`.
- Created `Final-Polished.docx`: translated remaining Arabic paragraphs + Likert-table statements into English and fixed the markdown-style `- Public School / - Private School` cell.
- Preserved the original by writing a backup `Final.before_polish.bak.docx`.
- Verified the polished DOCX contains **no Arabic characters** and **no markdown dash-list lines**.
- Render notes: LibreOffice `--convert-to png` produced only the first page; used DOCX → PDF → `pdftoppm` to render all pages (9 pages) under `tmp/docs/`.

## DeepSeek web gateway observability

- `scripts/openclaw_translation_orchestrator.py`: when calling the web gateway with an explicit `provider`, set the request `model` label to that provider (e.g. `deepseek-web`) for clearer job status + round reporting.
- `scripts/v4_pipeline.py`: notification formatting now prefers `generator/reviewer.provider` (for `agent_id=web_gateway`) over the ambiguous `model` string.

## Verification

- `./.venv/bin/python -m unittest discover -s tests -p 'test_*.py'` OK
